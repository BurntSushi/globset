/// A streaming reader for decompressing the contents of a file.

/// meant to be an alternative to using decompression libraries in favor of the
/// simplicity and portability of using external commands such as `gzip` and
/// `xz`. This does impose the overhead of spawning a process, so other means
/// for performing decompression should be sought if this overhead isn't
/// acceptable.
///
/// A decompression reader comes with a default set of matching rules that are
/// meant to associate file paths with the corresponding command to use to
/// decompress them. For example, a glob like `*.gz` matches gzip compressed
/// files with the command `gzip -d -c`. If a file path does not match any
/// existing rules, or if it matches a rule whose command does not exist in the
/// current environment, then the decompression reader passes through the
/// contents of the underlying file without doing any decompression.
///
/// The default matching rules are probably good enough for most cases, and if
/// they require revision, pull requests are welcome. In cases where they must
/// be changed or extended, they can be customized through the use of
/// [`DecompressionMatcherBuilder`](struct.DecompressionMatcherBuilder.html)
/// and
/// [`DecompressionReaderBuilder`](struct.DecompressionReaderBuilder.html).
///
/// By default, this reader will asynchronously read the processes' stderr.
/// This prevents subtle deadlocking bugs for noisy processes that write a lot
/// to stderr. Currently, the entire contents of stderr is read on to the heap.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows how to read the decompressed contents of a file without
/// needing to explicitly choose the decompression command to run.

/// Note that if you need to decompress multiple files, it is better to use
/// `DecompressionReaderBuilder`, which will amortize the cost of compiling the
