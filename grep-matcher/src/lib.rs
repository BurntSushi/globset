/*!
This crate provides an interface for regular expressions, with a focus on line
oriented search. The purpose of this crate is to provide a low level matching
interface that permits any kind of substring or regex implementation to power
the search routines provided by the
[`grep-searcher`](https://docs.rs/grep-searcher)
crate.

The primary thing provided by this crate is the
[`Matcher`](trait.Matcher.html)
trait. The trait defines an abstract interface for text search. It is robust
enough to support everything from basic substring search all the way to
arbitrarily complex regular expression implementations without sacrificing
performance.

A key design decision made in this crate is the use of *internal iteration*,
or otherwise known as the "push" model of searching. In this paradigm,
implementations of the `Matcher` trait will drive search and execute callbacks
provided by the caller when a match is found. This is in contrast to the
usual style of *external iteration* (the "pull" model) found throughout the
Rust ecosystem. There are two primary reasons why internal iteration was
chosen:

* Some search implementations may themselves require internal iteration.
  Converting an internal iterator to an external iterator can be non-trivial
  and sometimes even practically impossible.
* Rust's type system isn't quite expressive enough to write a generic interface
  using external iteration without giving something else up (namely, ease of
  use and/or performance).

In other words, internal iteration was chosen because it is the lowest common
denominator and because it is probably the least bad way of expressing the
interface in today's Rust. As a result, this trait isn't specifically intended
for everyday use, although, you might find it to be a happy price to pay if you
want to write code that is generic over multiple different regex
implementations.

    /// `memmem`), which is likely to be faster than whatever more generalized
    /// routine is required for resolving `\w+foo\s+`. The caller is then
    /// responsible for confirming whether a match exists or not.
